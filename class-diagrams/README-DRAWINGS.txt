Additionally, with regards to the class diagram, I know I've got a lot I probably need to include; Android app development is a new field to me, so I'm trying to figure out what components to use in order to realize a version of what I 'created' in Invision.

Furthermore, there are also getter methods associated with the Cheese and Tag classes for their member variables which I did not include on the diagram.
